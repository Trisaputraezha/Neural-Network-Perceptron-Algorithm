# Neural-Network-Perceptron-Algorithm
This project implements a Perceptron-based neural network for binary classification. It includes data preprocessing, model training, weight updates, and performance evaluation. The notebook demonstrates how the Perceptron algorithm learns decision boundaries using simple, interpretable computation.
